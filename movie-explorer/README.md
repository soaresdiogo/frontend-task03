# This project was written using the create-react-app boilerplate with typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## For this challenge, the concept of external react libraries was used, that is, a react-library project was created and published in the NPM repository for didactic levels

Clone this project and after entering the directory run the following command:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Click here to see the external library: [NPM reposit√≥rio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shared-components-movie-explorer).

Unit tests were used to create the components and cypress to test the application.
